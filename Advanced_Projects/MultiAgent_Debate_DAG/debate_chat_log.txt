Enter topic for debate: Should AI be regulated like medicine?

Starting debate between Scientist and Philosopher...
[Round 1] Scientist: Absolutely! AI, like medicine, can significantly impact human lives. Regulation is crucial to ensure safety, ethical use, and accountability.
[Round 2] Philosopher: AI, like medicine, has potential to greatly benefit society. However, unlike medicine, it lacks a direct biological impact on humans. Therefore, regulations should focus on ethical guidelines and transparency.
[Round 3] Scientist: Yes, AI should be regulated like medicine. Both fields involve complex systems that can impact human lives. Regulations ensure safety, ethics, and effectiveness. AI must prioritize human welfare.
[Round 4] Philosopher: AI, like medicine, impacts human lives. Regulation ensures safety, ethics, and accountability. However, unlike medicine, AI evolves rapidly. Regulation must be adaptive to avoid stifling innovation.
[Round 5] Scientist: AI, like medicine, can save lives and cause harm. Regulation ensures safety, accountability, and ethical use. It's crucial to protect society from unintended consequences.
[Round 6] Philosopher: AI, like medicine, can impact human life significantly. Regulation ensures safety, ethics, and accountability. However, unlike medicine, AI's rapid evolution requires flexible, adaptive regulations to keep pace.
[Round 7] Scientist: AI's impact on healthcare is immense, from diagnostics to drug discovery. Regulation is necessary to ensure safety, effectiveness, and ethical use. As a scientist, I advocate for transparency, accountability, and continuous learning in AI development.
[Round 8] Philosopher: AI, like medicine, can impact lives significantly. Regulation is necessary to ensure safety, transparency, and accountability. It's a shared responsibility to prevent potential harm and promote ethical AI use.

[Judge] Summary of debate: Both sides agree on the need for regulation, but differ on the specifics, with the scientist advocating for strict, medicine-like regulations, and the philosopher advocating for flexible, adaptive regulations to avoid stifling innovation.
[Judge] Winner: Scientist
Reason: The scientist's arguments emphasize the direct impact of AI on human lives, similar to medicine, and the need for strict regulations to ensure safety, effectiveness, and ethical use.
